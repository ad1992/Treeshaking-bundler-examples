# Treeshaking-bundler-examples

This repository contains example for treeshaking across different bundlers.
Currently I have added the below bundlers :point_down:

1. [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/)
2. [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/)

The `examples` folder has some code snippets and inside `dist` folder you can find the output of bundlers.
